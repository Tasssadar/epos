Authenticate as a specified user. The authentication stays
incomplete until a valid "pass" command is issued.
The control connection is initially in an "incomplete superuser"
authentication state. A successful authentication may have
effect on access restrictions, especially the "setl" command.
Successful superuser authentication may enable administrative
commands, such as "setg" or "down".
