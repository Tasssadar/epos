The files in this directory are a selection from the publicly available
mappings between the Unicode and selected eight bit encodings used
by Epos for language configurations and/or communication.

The authors of Epos don't claim any copyright to these files and they
humbly ask anybody interested in using them outside of Epos to download
an up-to-date version of the same files directly from the Unicode consortium.

The same source can be used to add any other encodings here (simply download
the required mapping file as is); or, you can easily write your own if you
prefer.
