RECENT CHANGES can be tracked at the BOTTOM END.  The rest doesn't qualify
as an exciting story, just skip it.

[ Note: some items mention who reported a bug or even did the
described modification.  The absence of such attribution
doesn't imply that the work did itself spontaneously.
Notably Pavel Machek, Adam Nohejl, Daniel Sobe, Mirek Trmac and Milan Zamazal
contributed in this way much more often than explicitly indicated here.     ]


1.1.1 from earlier releases (incomplete):
	- this file
	- debugging & other conditional compilation parameters have been moved
		to the config file. doc/debug.doc has been rewritten
	- fixed the array size in sss.cc to fit into the 64K DGROUP in DOS
	- fixed shriek() not to be volatile and to always take signed ints
	- allowed (hack) 16-bit ints in load_config and DOS HUGE memory model
	- "make tgz" (in sss/src) makes a tgz (in sss/src/../..) with the
		name sssX-Y-Z.tgz; the version numbers as read from common.h
		A copy is made on the diskette (if one is inserted at the moment).
	- "make date" outputs the last modification time

1.1.2 from 1.1.1	10.5.97
	- "make dos" creates a zipfile, not individual files
	- "make dos1250", "make dos1252" can produce two other encodings
	- in unit::sanity, fixed the range checks for pointer values
	- migrated the rest of non-ASCII chars out of the sources
	- migrated another bunch of options to the .ini file
	- allowed escape sequences and quoted strings in the .ini file
	- multiple tiny code amendments
	- no compile-time checking for the memory model
	- run-time check whether we've been compiled fully 32-bit (again)
	- changed warning flags to -Wall -Wno-parentheses -Wno-unused
	- new option type: DEBUG_AREA (enum, just for focus_dbg)
	- interf.h uglified
	- side syllables hacked out. See unit:syll_break for more info.
		The feature can be disabled in the .ini file (syll_break())
		cfg/nonsyl.dic has been consequently cleaned up.
	- the sonority rule no longer considers nasals as more sonorous than
		the ordinary consonants. Hope it doesn't hurt.
	- parser now can accept keyboard input & other minor improvements there
	- new files in the doc directory: Intro, Files

1.1.3 from 1.1.2	14.5.97
	- enums UNIT, OPT_TYPE suffer formally renamed elements because of Borland
	- BOOL, INT, STR (formerly STRING),... in config.cc are always #defined now
	- a new diphone inventory description (.dph) - the traditional one.
		Very crude, lots of the diphones discarded (incl. W[{>,` etc.)
		This inventory doesn't cover some allophones at all, see default.rul
	- in unit::set_father(), f,i,t will be inherited (untested). This should 
		allow phone-level f,i,t adjustments propagated to the diphones.
	- unit::diph() optionally allows repeated diphones (have a look there).
	- we now allow "triphones" (like "a'a", a.k.a. "a|a" in traditnl.dph)
	- the default rules contain one killer rule (until traditnl.dph is fixed)

1.1.4 from 1.1.3	19.5.97
	- optional hash table profiling; configurable hash table full percentage
	- removed a word-length quadratic complexity aspect of subst() by not 
		checking too long words (longer than hash::longest). Typically,
		this "feature" will cause an overall slowdown. :-)
	- fixed unit::subst to loop until there's nothing to substitute
	- traditnl.dph is less crude now, it only doesn't solve the voiced 
		affricates now. We still never use many important diphones.
	- some big fixed-length auto arrays have been made static & malloced
	- introduced cfg.safe_grow, but still not configurable

1.1.5 from 1.1.4	22.5.97
	- '\0' shall be replaced by '_' in parser::getch; '\0' never gets output.
	- unit::fout is much more configurable now, see config.cc
	- tabs regularized to eight chars

1.1.6 from 1.1.5	27.5.97
	- config.cc #inclusion scheme has been substantially reworked
	- aggregate (array...) config options are now possible, see config.cc
	- unit::fout is even more configurable now. And slower as well.
	- ANSI escape sequences mostly made configurable
	- can remove elements from the hash tables now
	- invalid options are checked against
	- fixed pointer sanity checks (when trusted_ptr==off)
	- added doc/output.doc

1.1.7 from 1.1.6	28.5.97
	- fixed a stupid "last byte swallowing" bug
	- added diphtong rules, made traditnl.dph handle diphtongs better
	- too high level symbols, which could make the parser prematurely
		terminate a substitution, are checked against (parser::done)
	- gather now gathers everything, thus preserving syllables etc.
		during substitutions. This makes work multiple multilevel
		substitutions, such as "ououo" -> "ou|ou|o".
	- prep is temporarily broken

1.1.8 from 1.1.7	29.5.97
	- fixed prep &c (bug having to do with M_EXACT and unit::gather())
	- if a preposition occurs at the end of a colon, let it be fatal
	- added the FILE cfg option type
	- deuglified load_config()


1.2.-1 from 1.1.8	30.5.97
	- converted all printf's to redirectable calls. Use "stddbg_file",
		"stdshriek_file", "stdwarn_file" in sss.ini to redirect them.
		An exception is user_pause(), which should never be redirected
	- renamed sss to ss, 'cause 'tis shorta.
	- colorize() now doesn't check against redirected input
	- rewrote the stuff about ss_init(), multiple .ini files
	- at the very beginning, the debug output may go temporarily
		to the screen. It will be redirected properly after
		the .ini file which uses it is redirected.
	- we now have cfg/ssfixed.ini and ss.ini instead of sss.ini.
		Any values in ss.ini override those in ssfixed.ini. The idea 
		is not to bury the oft-changing params in the permanent ones.
	- the "markup_language" configuration parameter (MUST be located
		in ssfixed.ini!, possible values: none, ansi, rtf) allows
		run-time switching between ANSI output and the Rich Text Format
		output. Either ssansi.ini or ssrtf.ini is processed after
		ssfixed.ini
	- ss_reinit() can be used to re-read the config files. Not fool-proof.
	- ss_init() shall be used instead of load_config()

1.2.0 from 1.2.-1	1.6.97
	- cfg/ssdeflt.ini (used by ss_reinit()) is now automagically generated
		from src/config.cc (on "make")
	- Makefile deuglified a little bit
	- fixed hash::hash (empty lines had been creating phantom items)
	- doc/output.doc includes new topics (e.g. debugging info redirection)
	- fixed safe_grow and max_line_len to be configurable
	- got finally rid of ANSI escape sequences in config.cc
	- made '~' a valid word separator (e.g. in a dictionary)

1.2.1 from 1.2.0	13.6.97
	- fixed some of the silly Borland warnings
	- removed -Wno-parentheses (and fixed some lines which got it)
	- added nnet.cc (neural networks' input - see doc/neuralnet.doc)
	- consistently changed "auxiliary syllable" to "side syllable"
	- changed warning flags to -Wall with no exceptions
	- faked the use of unused function arguments, see unused() in common.h
	- added the "text" abstraction (src/text.*) to handle #include in rules
	- maybe fixed a DOS CR/LF freadin() bug
	- gather() called after the diphones get created now shrieks gracefully

1.2.2 from 1.2.1	 2.7.97
	- no code change, makefile adjusted for the files that were new in 1.2.1

1.2.3 from 1.2.2	 7.7.97
	- minor code changes in text.*, chasing a DOS-only Heisenbug (lost)

1.2.4 from 1.2.3	 14.9.97
	- fixed this==NULL sanity check in unit::sanity()
	- made parser skip any garbage (whitespace?) until the first phone
	- minor amendments to text.cc
	- made hash.cc a little bit more commentproof
	- when DEBUG is defined, free() is #defined to paranoid_free() (see)
	- fixed tmps declaration in rules::str2rule() (the DOS-only bug?)
	- improved cfg/syll.dic (laryngeal stop before word-initial vocals)
	- fixed long vowels in the nnet code (unit::nnet_type())
	- the glottal stop is now a valid voiceless stop for the nnet code

1.2.5 from 1.2.4	29.9.97
	- added doc/COPYING (GNU Public License - copyleft) to fix the legalese
	- the paranoid_free() hack from 1.2.4 has been removed. Because,
	- dmalloc (debugging mem alloc()) library is used #ifdef WANT_DMALLOC
	- fixed a fence-post error (rules::rules::ruleline one byte too short)
	- rules::resolve_vars now uses a pseudostatic buffer (was call-lived)
	- the FOREVER macro should be used to mark permanent memory allocations
	- some minor memory leaks have been found and fixed
	- rewrote hash::hash to make it even more commentproof, but messier
	- "make clean" tries to clean up the Makefile and report some settings
	- cleaned up parser::parser, parser.cc now depends on interf.cc::freadin()

1.2.6 from 1.2.5	29.10.97
	- partly allowed deletion of the last phone in a syllable
	- const char * everywhere to be -Wwrite-strings clean
	- hash collisions are now handled with a balanced AVL tree
	- furthermore, on hash table over/underflow it is completely rehashed
	- made the only nnet.rules substitution not destroy syllables
	- fixed a trailing whitespace bug in hash:hash
	- it is possible to remove the diphones with "DIPHONES ~" rule
	- option to dump the diphones at every DIPHONES rule (immed_diphones)
	- added a punctuation hack into the nnet rules and similar minor fixes

	- added rules to mark wh-quesions as such
	- if there is nothing for a postp/preposition to join to, it's ignored

	- inline is never used under DOS, Borland can't handle it properly
	- snprintf is no longer used, it is unportable

	- new rule type SMOOTH - smoothen suprasegmentalia (doc/rules.doc)
	- unit::project() - move suprasegmental adjustments to a certain level
	- some short command options, still undocumented

	- invent_dir now points to /usr/lib/ss
	- improved prosody and other rules
