This file is not a part of Epos documentation, nor any kind of plan
for the project.  It is rather a private list of some of the known
tasks which might be carried out in the future to enhance Epos.
It is included only to get a feeling what the less research minded one
of the authors tends to think about.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs
- better prosody modelling for monosyllaba
- fallbacks may reinterpret segment numbers in the old format

Features
- pause hierarchy rules
- parsing rules (e.g. for angle/square brackets,
  dots as opposed to periods, dollar signs)
- grammatical marking
- properly cased ordinal numerals
- SSML parser
- asynchronous, more robust tcpsyn
- tcpsyn - explicit voice options of local server should be used by the remote
- t i adjustment option
- TCP wrappers & auth config & /etc/epos.users
- reasonable logging
- investigate the optimum pause lengths
- utf-8

Optimisations
- sync_soundcard() should be replaced with an asyncro thing
- eliminate class connection_lost
- initialiser lists instead of constructor code

Miscelannea
- examine the --_input_text and --input_file options
- document waveform labels in ttscp.sgml - waveform format description

Should Check
- behavior of intr with something other than oa_wavefm (may miss 123 or 122)
- investigate segment free utterance handling
- TTSCP error codes, esp. those related to options and values, should be revised
- what if I change max_line?
- whether decoding and encoding is properly done for all data types - also cmd_show
- some characters from mathsign.dic, $, etc. might be misread in some contexts
- behavior of syll in boundary cases - unit testing
