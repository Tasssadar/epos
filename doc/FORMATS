If you have a recent version of sgml-tools installed, you can compile
the documentation into various formats:

make epos.txt		text-only doc, to be viewed with "less"
make epos.dvi		finely typeset doc, to be printed with "dvips"
make epos.ps		postscript file, as above
make epos.html		a hypertext documentation, to be viewed e.g. with "lynx"
make epos.info		GNU info documentation, to be viewed with "info" or "emacs"

If you are a developer, please make any changes to the original .sgml files only
The other formats are generated automatically from the .sgml source files as
shown.

Possibly outdated notes: Necessary changes to the sgml-tools.

(i)   &ecaron; should be understood as an "e" with a caron
	or replaced with just plain "e" in intro.sgml
(ii)  /usr/lib/sgml-tools/dist/fmt_latex2e.pl must not escape
      | at every context. This would break the <tabular ca="...">
      tag.
(iii) had to \input english.sty (from babel) somewhere, e.g. in linuxdoc.sty
      to avoid "undefined language" errors
(iv)  had to change the &commat; entity handling in
      /usr/lib/entity-map/*/ISOnum.2html
      (translate commat; to a simple @ character instead of &commat;).
      Without this change, the resulting html (almost) does work with
      the lynx browser, but it doesn't work e.g. with Netscape Navigator.

(maybe maybe not)
