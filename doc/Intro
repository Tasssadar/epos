	OS requirements	
	---------------

	The following systems have been able to compile and run Epos in the past:

	Linux, QNX, Digital UNIX, Ultrix, SVR4
	DOS (including version 95, NT, 2000, XP)

	Only the Linux 2.x and WinNT ports are considered maintained, the rest
	will probably require some minor tweaking. Please contact us if you plan
	to use some other architecture and/or are willing to take care of some
	other port for a medium or long period of time.  We'll try to help you start.
