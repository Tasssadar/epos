We are considering including PortAudio 18 or pre-19 at this place
and building it conditionally.  We cannot use a system-wide
pre-installed PortAudio instead as it never includes PABLIO.

If you want to put portaudio here and reconfigure with
--enable-portaudio=yes
please don't forget to distclean the whole tree and then
to disable the output of libs/portaudio/Makefile in
Epos configure.ac (so that Epos doesn't feel responsible
for this directory anymore).

This situation is temporary.  (Or it was in April 2005.)

Instructions
============

 1. Put the contents of the downloaded portaudio tarball
	in this directory.
 2. cd libs/portaudio
 3. build portaudio, you can use these commands:
	./configure
	make
 4. build pablio, you can use these commands
	gcc -c -g -O2 -Ipa_common pablio/pablio.c -o pablio/pablio.o
	ar ruv lib/libpablio.a pablio/pablio.o
	ranlib lib/libpablio.a
