The Epos project was originally started by Jirka Hanika and Petr Horak.
The following people contributed to the Epos project at least by reporting
problems and suggesting improvements, but sometimes by designing and writing
a marvelous large independent component of Epos.  Without these people,
Epos wouldn't evolve.

Adam Nohejl
Andreas Jochens
Daniel Sobe
Jakub Adamek
Jan Jirmasek
Jeremy Huddleston
Karl Chen
Larry Gilbert
Martin MichlMayr
Martin Petriska
Milan Zamazal
Miloslav Trmac
Pavel Machek
Vit Stradal
Zdenek Kadlec

and those accidentally forgotten; please remind us if you
notice somebody missing, or if you wish your name removed.

We are also deeply grateful for the cooperation of the
Institute of Phonetics of the Charles University, Prague, and the
Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics, Czech Academy of Sciences,
Prague, and of their researchers who gave us a stimulating environment,
background to start from, and their most valuable company.
Without these people, Epos wouldn't be written.

Additional thanks go to numerous benefactors in the research
and free software communities who helped us either by making
useful ideas, tools and resources available or by advice,
and to the speakers whose recorded articulation and prosody
Epos only tries to imitate.
