Files in this directory support the "make upload" target from the top
source directory.  This target releases the distribution to SourceForge.

"make distcheck" is expected before "make upload".

mail.once must be a file in the top source directory.
It may be either 0 bytes long or at least 20 bytes long.
Its contents should be a human readable message to be
included in the autogenerated announcement and as the
release notes.

/usr/local/bin/sf-upload should be the sf-upload script which
is available in a separate project sf-upload from SourceForge itself.

You can check the files used with the last release (distribution,
changes, notes, autogenerated announcement) in the last_upload directory.
